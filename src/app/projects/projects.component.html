                    <p matLine>The thesis work involves analysis and visualization of big data, generated by machines in
                        the cutting industry. The analysis was done by using artificial intelligence trained on
                        sequential data to predict tool failure. When identifying a data sequence that could potentially
                        lead to a tool failure, the machine operator is notified via a mobile application installed on a
                        portable device. The data visualizations consist of interactive line charts and time-sorted
                        lists of machine events. The interactive line diagrams are two-dimensional and show measurement
                        values originating from any machine's sensors along the y axis and time along the x axis. The
                        interactivity available to users in the line graphs is zooming, panning, and clickable data
                        points.</p>
