        "The main reason for this website is that I like creating stuff, always have. This will be the main platform I test and share stuff I create. For better or worse I easily get bored if I'm not actively doing something. So this place will be the main outlet of my boredom. My aim is to update this website with new features weekly.",

        "Since yesterday I have been coding quite a bit on this web application. Most of the work is concerning the look and feel of the application. That means there has been a lot of html and css googling/coding going on.",
        "I don't write vanilla html/css since the web app is built using Angular, which is a Javascript framework [1]. I'm also using a user interface component library called Angular Material that helps developers in creating attractive, consistent, and functional web applications [2]. The reasons behind these choices are mainly out of convenience. I'm familiar with both the framwork and the component library since both were used when we created Exam Center. Even when using these powerful web application programming tools you still have to make adjustments to make the web application look good on all various device screens. For debugging I use Google Chrome, and ItÂ´s the only one I'h been using significantly [3]. In the future I'm going try out Microsoft Edge which is also Chromium based but more lightweight (faster) than Google Chrome [3][4][5].",
        "The screen height is now fixed, only the overflowing content make the scrollbar appear. Personally I think it did a lot for the look and feel of the application, I'h also added expandable panels in the blog/projects section to avoid text cluttering.",
